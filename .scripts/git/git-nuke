# CAUTION: BEWARE OF THIS SCRIPT! #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# This script prunes remote branches and
# deletes local branches with no remote counterpart
# INCLUDING UNMERGED BRANCHES WITH NO REMOTE
#
# This means that if you have an unmerged branch and
# someone deleted its remote counterpart for some reason
# without merging it first, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR WORK
#
# Beware that this script DELETES LOCAL BRANCHES
# WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN PUSHED YET.
# TODO: Add a --safe flag to avoid this
#
# For a lighter version see bin/git-bomb
